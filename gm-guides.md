## Threads:  

Because of Dungeon World's play to find out, it is better to present threads. If you pull on any of these, the world of the 7 kingdoms will start to unravel.  

1. Stopping the Northern Dwarven Slavers
2. Finding out what lies underneath the central sea.
3. Learning the truth about the Druids of the Sapphire Islands.
4. Awakening what lies dormant under the sands of the forgotten Kingdom.
5. Tracking down the wild wind monk.
6. Singing the Chariot Song of the Elders to the Elven Queen.
7. Discovering the lost tomb of the ancient Elven King.
8. Crossing the Endless Dessert
9. Destroying the Vampire of Argos
10. Burning the Library of Nemis
11. Uncovering the plot of the principalities of Trisbes
12. Conversing with the dead dwarves of Ekros Mill.


Any of these actions will cause upheaval in the world. Why? Play to find out.  

## Impending Dooms:
However if nothing happens at all, these impending dooms are like water about to boil. Something must be done about them.

1. The Northern Lynch's growing appetite (appetite for what? slaves? power? magic?) What does he do with the slaves?
2. The Impending attack of the centaurs of the plains. Once the weather changes, hordes of centaurs spill out of the steppes and put pressure on all races and kingdoms.

## Quests:
1. There are coins of remembering strews across the realm and each can be used to figure out any of these forgotten knowledge items.
2. Dwarven sword-smiths are always on the lookout for magical bottles of air that they use as respirators. They pay handsomely for them and many will have leads as to where to find them.

## House Rules
**Hard Bargains Melee**
You attack succeeds but...
On a 7â€“9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.
Or...
1. your weapon is stuck in their armor (Defy Danger to pull it out.)
2. you deal -1d6 damage
3. blood splatters in your eyes
4. your clothes get tangled, take a -2 forward on your the next action
5. your weapon is knocked out of your hand. -->

### New Tags:  
__Monsters:__  
**Trample:**
(reach) Smaller foes must move out of the way (possibly with defy danger) or suffer normal damage. (reach range attack) Attack is always successful no roll needed, just roll for damage.
