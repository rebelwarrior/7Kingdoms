# Frequently Asked Questions

### Are there other wizards?

Well maybe. That wizards have existed in the past is known for sure. But do the wizards of the principalities weild magic, or do they simply posses magical items? That is unknown. Wizards invariably cover their faces, hide their features. Once upon a time, an evil wizard tried to enslave a whole kingdom, or so the legend goes, the kingdom is no more, but afterwards wizards were persecuted for years, so they hide their identities since. Or maybe they're all deformed from weilding inhuman magic? 

### How common is magic?

Magic is not common but not so rare that most come in contact with it at least once in their lives. Magical potions can be found in towns and cities. Everyone is aware of the existance of the Wizard principalities. There magic is more common. However, one can spend a long life and one's only iteration being running into a cleric passing through town. Magic items are all very rare and fairly unique. 

### Where do Paladins get their name?

From the god Pallas, maybe?

### Are salamanders known?

No. A salamander (from the class Immolator) is an extra planar creature and unique. 

### What about firearms?

None.
