## Druid:
![ElvenDruid][druid]

Druids also called shamans talk to the spirits of the land and can commune with the powers of the land itself to create magical effects.

__Shapeshifter:__
A Druid can shape-shift any number of times in a day.
Shapeshifting into animal form or back doesn't make you any more vulnerable to attack than you already are at that moment.
When you shape-shift you keep your armor, but loose your shield bonus unless your animal form can handle the shield (like a gorilla for example, but not a horse).
If one of the moves the GM gives you in your altered form is a type of attack you **keep all your attack bonuses (if any) to attack**, but *damage* may be limited or enhanced by the form.

_Note:_ When you have shape-shifted, you can understand everything said to you in animal form so long as your character would be able to understand your allies if it were in humanoid form in the same place. For example if you shape-shift into a fish, you can somewhat hear and understand your allies speaking below the water, but those outside are mumbled and you can't make them out.

Missing a Shape-shift roll: on a 6 or below you still shape-shift but __an unfortunate side effect__ also occurs. This may be anything, though a typical one is being unable to transform back (to a humanoid form or anything else) until you complete a simple innocuous action in the animal form. For example if you turn into a slippery fish to elude the grasp of a foe, but roll low. The DM can say you cannot transform back until you complete the move _Eat an insect_ till then you allies must find a way to get you into water or you'll suffocate as a fish on land.

#### Example Animals with example Moves the GM may grant:

Bear (The Great Forests, The Frozen North)  
  - *Maul*: Your attack gains the *messy* tag and +2 to damage. You may not attack for stun damage.  
  - *Tear Apart*: You can rip apart an opponent's armor (even if it's natural armor) or dig into them if they have no armor dealing maximum damage + level.
  - *Grizzly Roar*: Nearby foes take a -1 forward or flee the area.

Boar (The Great Forests, The Blasted Wasteland)  
  - *Fearless Charge*: Choose an opponent to target the charge: +2 to attack that opponent but that opponent gets +2 damage against you if you miss the attack or get attacked back in a hard bargain.
  - *Scavenge*: If available, you can find any plant that's edible and you know the smell of in your location.

Bobcat (The Towering Mountains)  
  - *Move Silently*: You can sneak up on opponents.
  - *Pounce*: You can land an attack on an opponent after a jump. Your attack gains the *precise* tag.
  - *Crepuscular Sight*: You can see in the twilight as well as day.

Wild Horse (The Whispering Plains)  
  - *Galloping Escape*: You are one of the fastest animals, on land you can maintain sustained speeds of 27mph up to two miles.  
  - *Trample them*: Smaller foes must defy danger to move out of the way or suffer your normal damage. (reach range attack, no attack roll needed attack is always successful if the foes fail to move out of the way.)

Wolf (The Frozen North, The Whispering Plains)  
  - *Track*: You automatically can track any creature a wolf can up to a week after they've crossed the area (unless you are tracking a Ranger or Druid, which are much harder to track) or may take +2 to your roll to track.
  - *Bite the hand*: You disarm the opponent.

Eagle (The Towering Mountains, The Whispering Plains)  
  - *Flight*: You can soar above your opponents.
  - *Eagle Sight*: You can see minute detail even from high above or far away.

Mouse (Farms, The Vast Desert, The Whispering Plains)  
  - *Sneak*: Big opponents have a hard time seeing you or hitting you.

Cobra (The Vast Desert, The Blasted Wasteland)  
  - *Inflict poison*: Poison a foe in close range. That foe suffers effects the same as _Serpent's Tears_ poison.  
  - *Drive them back*: Foes in close proximity retreat.

Python (The Stinking Mire)  
  - *Enrapt*: Grapple with foe in touch range. All attacks to you and the grappled foe from others take a +1 and ignore armor while the grapple is in place.  
  - *Constrict*: Once you have a grapple on a foe, deal normal damage (typically 1d6) with a +1 damage bonus for every additional round you continuously constrict the foe.

Animal Limitations:
  There are no tigers in the lands of the 7 kingdoms. They may not be chosen as an animal. Elephants are rare and belong to none of the Lands but if you meet one you may study their essence.


Modified Ability:  
__Red of Tooth and Claw:__ (add this text) You may assume Dire version of animals.  
__Blood and Thunder:__ (add this text) You may assume Were versions of animals.

## Fighter:
![ElvenFighter][elvenfighter]
![DwarvenFighter][dwarvenfighter]

Warriors, soldiers, and the famed defenders of the realm while many know how to fight the _fighter_ class is a true warrior, trained, honed, capable. Many fighters in the 7K don't do it as a full-time, many are farmers, builders, craftmen but all have the strength to protect civilization.

> `"The spit and blood fill your mouth, dirt bites your eyes and yet, one simply does not give up." - King Rodus of Alaria`

---
## Cleric (Exorcist/Necromancer):
The cleric class is called Exorcist or Necromancer (for evil ones).
![DwarvenExorcist][dwarvenexorcist]  
> `"When I put you in the ground you'll stay in the ground!" - Thundar, Dwarven Exorcist`

A Necromancer has "Command the Undead" instead of "Turn Undead".

Necromancer:  
Modified Ability:
**Command Undead:** On a 10+ the necromancer gains control of mindless undead equal to  WIS bonus plus intelligent undead must make a defy danger roll and either flee or be commanded. On a 7-9 controls random mindless undead equal to WIS bonus. Range is speaking distance (around 12 feet). This ability substitutes Turn Undead.

Added Ability:
**Death is Aware of You**: If you are a necromancer take -1 ongoing to Last Breath rolls.

Added Advanced Ability:
**Grim Harvest** (level 2-5)
When you take time after a conflict to desecrate the dead take +2 forward on spell-casting and healing checks.

Added Spell:
**Vampiric Touch** (level one)

---
## Ranger:
![Ranger2][ranger2]
![Ranger][ranger]  
The trackers, scouts and hunters of the 7K, they can mostly be found on the fringes of civilization or in-between places. They have a connection with the land, few in civilized places do. 

> `"Hear me. Never flee from a Ranger. Better to face them in battle immediately than to have them hunt you down..."  - Stalwart Warrior`

---
## Wizard:
Wielders of arcane arts. They cover their faces and identities to protect their families. It can be hard to tell if they are female or male.  
![Wizard][wizard]
> `"I don't much like them, but they come in handy in a pinch." -- Captain Friggard.`

---
## Paladin:
Some fight for glory, others for money, some even to safe-guard their families, their lands, their kingdoms, but the paladin fight for a calling to protect the defenseless.

Paladins cover their hair if female, their head if male.

---
## Thief:
Quiet as as ghosts they prowl, maybe working for a living is not for them, maybe it is proving their worth, or maybe this is all they know how to do. Why toil in life when so many good things are just ripe for the taking?
Caravans full of riches travel your land; maybe they should pay a toll for that, and why not you to collect it?

> `"All adventures are thieves... just some are honest about it."`

---
## Bard:
![ElvenBard][elvenbard]  
Bards study a magic born of nature's music.  
**Arcane Art's** effects don't stack with multiple singing, for example a single bard can't give more that one +1d4 forward to damage to a single ally. In the case of healing once an ally has been healed they can't be healed again until their HP change either by taking more damage or by additional healing of another kind or source.   
Arcane Art's effect from another bard is considered from a separate source and handled independently and thus may stack.

> `"They're said to have once been students of magic that played music to pay for their studies. Then they discovered magic in music... or so the legends say..."  - a traveling bard. `

---
## Barbarian:
![Barbarian][barbarian]  
Since time immemorial civilized people have slept with one eye open on the horizon, fearing that their barbarian brethren may awaken, unite and attack with the ferociousness of the wilds they inhabit.

> `"I'm telling you, don't mess with the barbarians. They're not only uncivilized, they have no love for civilization..." -- Ral, Inn keeper River's Den`

>`"Civilized nations never, never have selfish motives for butchering, raping and looting; only horrid barbarians have those..." -- Robert E. Howard`
