## Druid:
![ElvenDruid][druid]

Druids also called shamans talk to the spirits of the land and can commune with the powers of the land itself to create magical effects.

__Shapeshifter:__
A Druid can shape-shift any number of times in a day.
Shapeshifting into animal form or back doesn't make you any more vulnerable to attack than you already are at that moment.
When you shape-shift you keep your armor, but loose your shield bonus unless your animal form can handle the shield (like a gorilla for example, but not a horse).
If one of the moves the GM gives you in your altered form is a type of attack you **keep all your attack bonuses (if any) to attack**, but *damage* may be limited or enhanced by the form.


<!-- _Note:_ When you have shape-shifted __you cannot speak with your allies unless the animal can__. A bear can nod or shake its head for simple yes or no, but not much else, for example. Your spirit animal, however, retains the ability to speak normally.  -->

_Note:_ When you have shape-shifted, you can understand everything said to you in animal form so long as your character would be able to understand your allies if it were in humanoid form in the same place. For example if you shape-shift into a fish, you can somewhat hear and understand your allies speaking below the water, but those outside are mumbled and you can't make them out.

Missing a Shape-shift roll: on a 6 or below you still shape-shift but __an unfortunate side effect__ also occurs. This may be anything, though a typical one is being unable to transform back (to a humanoid form or anything else) until you complete a simple innocuous action in the animal form. For example if you turn into a slippery fish to elude the grasp of a foe, but roll low. The DM can say you cannot transform back until you complete the move _Eat an insect_ till then you allies must find a way to get you into water or you'll suffocate as a fish on land.

Wolf (The Frozen North, The Whispering Plains)

  There are no tigers in the lands of the 7 kingdoms. They may not be chosen as an animal. Elephants are rare and belong to none of the Lands but if you meet one you may study their essence.

<!-- Added Ability:  
__Sprit Animal:__
At the creation of the character select a spirit animal from your Land or Lands. Take a +1 forward when shapeshifting into this animal when you are inside your Lands. Unlike other animal forms you retain the ability to speak when you take your spirit animal's form. -->

Warriors, soldiers, and the famed defenders of the realm while many know how to fight the _fighter_ class is a true warrior, trained, honed, capable. Many fighters in the 7K don't do it as a full-time, many are farmers, builders, craftmen but all have the strength to protect civilization.

## Ranger:
![Ranger2][ranger2]
![Ranger][ranger]  
The trackers and scouts of the 7K, they can mostly be found on the fringes of civilization or in-between places.

> `"Hear me. Never flee from a Ranger. Better to face them in battle immediately than to have them find you in the middle of the night asleep."  - Stalwart Warrior`

## Wizard:
They cover their faces and identities to protect their families. It can be hard to tell if they are female or male.  
![Wizard][wizard]
> `"I don't much like them, but they come in handy in a pinch." -- Captain Friggard.`

## Paladin:
Some fight for glory, others for money, some even to safe-guard their families, their lands, their kingdoms, but the paladin fight for a calling to protect the defenseless.

Paladins cover their hair if female, their head if male.  
![Paladin][paladin]  
> ` "Once they guarded the most precious... maybe they still do." - Wizard Jenkins`

## Thief:
<!-- Quiet as as ghosts they prowl, maybe working for a living is not for them, maybe it is proving their worth, or maybe this is all they know how to do. Why toil in life when so many good things are just ripe for the taking?
Maybe caravans full of riches travel your land, maybe they should pay a toll for that, and why not you to collect it? -->

<small> Thief from the Sand Kingdom.  </small>

<small> Halfling Thief  </small>  
![KenderThief][kenderthief]

## Bard:
![ElvenBard][elvenbard]  
Bards study a magic born of nature's music.  
**Arcane Art's** effects don't stack with multiple singing, for example a single bard can't give more that one +1d4 forward to damage to a single ally. In the case of healing once an ally has been healed they can't be healed again until their HP change either by taking more damage or by additional healing of another kind or source.   
Arcane Art's effect from another bard is considered from a separate source and handled independently and thus may stack.

> `"They're said to have once been students of magic that played music to pay for their studies. Then they discovered magic in music... or so the legends say..."  - a traveling bard. `

## Barbarian:
![Barbarian][barbarian]  
Since time immemorial civilized people have slept with one eye open on the horizon, fearing that their barbarian brethren may awaken, unite and attack with the ferociousness of the wilds they inhabit.

> `"I'm telling you, don't mess with the barbarians. They're not only uncivilized, they have no love for civilization..." -- Ral, Inn keeper River's Den`

>`"Civilized nations never, never have selfish motives for butchering, raping and looting; only horrid barbarians have those..." -- Robert E. Howard`

## New Tags:  
__Monsters:__
