**Dwarf:**  The metal-smiths of the seven kingdoms. And as such, they have a huge preference and familiarity with hammers. They are consumed with the afterlife, which make them dour creatures. They typically can't swim and are mortified of large bodies of water. They are known to be taciturn and gruff, but are lively when drunk. While the complete opposite of Halflings in personality they are known to get along, though typically by flinging insults at each other in rapid succession. Dwarves are famously known to be the _only_ ones that can get asking-price from Halflings consistently. Dwarves hate negotiating and usually just state a price, but after half-an-hour of insults Dwarves usually get their price from Halflings merchants almost every time. While it is a myth that dwarves live only underground, most are truly uneasy in wide open spaces. 

**Elf:** Who knows about them but themselves? Secretive, xenophobic and magical. Little is known about them. They are long lived, lovers of music, beauty and magic. A great piece of music is known to bring them to silent tears. Most creatures find them aloof and uncaring. They have strange believes about death that make them take the death of shorter lived creatures as very inconsequential. This gets them into trouble with Dwarves who hold their dead ancestors in high reverence.

**Halfling:** Curious, mildly kleptomaniac, they are sea traders and live almost all their lives on boats. It is unknown where they come. They speak very fast and are probably the best merchants in town and the thieves' fence at the same time. Halflings are pretty much all over, particularly if there is a merchant or need for one anywhere near. They are very fond of trinkets and shiny things, yet don't care much for money at all and prefer to barter. Even though they maybe rich, halflings typically look like paupers, walking barefoot in comfortable but utilitarian clothes. They love to eat and will spend a lot for great food, good company, good wine and a merry song. The opposite of dwarves, who are serious and very concerned with the afterlife, halflings are completely consumed by the right now and very much unserious. They are notorious for their fleet fingers and pickpocketing and their dark humor. One of their favorite things to do is to "borrow" your coins then invite you to a drink and pay for everything with _your_ own money. They once had a language of their own, but none know it now and they speak whatever language of the people they barter with. 
Physically they look like children with pointy ears. They have large feet, much larger than you'd think, in proportion to their bodies, and if you look very closely you might see a few have webbed feet. Almost all Halflings can swim extremely well. Halflings Druids, while rare, are always related to water (_The Open Sea_, _The River Delta_ or _The Sapphire Islands_).
Halfling Fighters typically use a special walking stick with a sling on top (similar to a lacrosse stick) as their signature weapon.

**Outsider:** Many races can be outsiders, from the wild elves that escape slavery among the centaurs, to the under-dwarfs that betray their kin or even the wild-men of Nor. They are treated with dread or even repulsion by the people of the kingdoms but sometimes they earn deep respect. They all share a deep sense of survival, a connection with their environments and the casual brutality of people who grow-up in harsh environments.

**Automaton:** Are they alive or dead? This sentient machines were built by ancient power a long ago and have survived multiple cataclysms. Unfortunately most are in an inactive broken state. What would happen if they were somehow fixed?
