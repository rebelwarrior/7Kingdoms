**Dwarf:**  The metal-smiths of the 7 kingdoms. And as such they have a huge preference and familiarity with hammers. They are consumed with the afterlife, which make them dour creatures. They typically can't swim and are mortified of large bodies of water. They are known to be taciturn and gruff, but are lively when drunk. While the complete opposite of Halflings in personality they are known to get along, though typically by flinging insults at each other in rapid succession. Dwarves are famously known to be the _only_ ones that can get asking-price from Halflings consistently. Dwarves hate negotiating and usually just state a price, but after half-an-hour of insults Dwarves usually get their price from Halflings merchants almost every time.

**Elf:** Who knows about them but themselves? Secretive, xenophobic and magical. Little is known about them. They are long lived, lovers of music, beauty and magic. A great piece of music is known to bring them to silent tears. Most creatures find them aloof and uncaring. They have strange believes about death that make them take the death of shorter lived creatures as very inconsequential. This gets them into trouble with Dwarves who hold their dead ancestors in high reverence.

**Halfling:** Mix of Kender and hobbits. Curious, mildly kleptomaniac, they are sea traders and live almost all their lives on boats. It is unknown where they come. They speak very fast and are probably the best merchant in town and the thieves fence at the same time. Halflings are pretty much all over, particularly if there is a merchant or need for one anywhere near. They are very fond of trinkets and shiny things. Don't care much for money at all and prefer to barter. Even though they maybe rich the halflings typically look like paupers, walking barefoot in comfortable but simple clothes. They love to eat and will spend a lot for great food, good wine and a merry song. They are kind of the opposite of dwarves who are serious and very concerned with the afterlife, the halflings are very much unserious and completely consumed by the right now. They are notorious for their fleet fingers and pickpocketing and their dark humor. One of the favorite things halflings love to do is to "borrow" your coins then invite you to a drink and pay for everything with your money.

Halflings Druids are rare are always related to water (The Open Sea or The River Delta or The Sapphire Islands).
Halfling Fighters typically use a special walking stick with a sling on top (similar to a lacrosse stick) as their signature weapon.
Physically they look like skinny children with pointy ears. They have large feet, much larger than you'd think in proportion to their bodies, and if you look very closely you might see a few have webbed feet. Almost all Halflings can swim.

**Outsider:** Many races can be outsiders, from the wild elves that escape slavery among the centaurs, to the under-dwarfs that betray their kin or even the wild-men of Nor. They are treated with dread or even repulsion by the people of the kingdom but sometimes they earn deep respect. They all share a deep sense of survival, a connection with their environments and the casual brutality of people who grow-up in harsh environments.

**Automaton:** Are they alive or dead? This sentient machines were built by ancient power a long ago and have survived multiple cataclysms. Unfortunately most are in an inactive broken state. What would happen if they were somehow fixed?
